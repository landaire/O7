# O7 Sound Mod for World of Warships

A sound mod for World of Warships containing audio events by O7 clan and friends.

## Installation

Download the latest version of the mod pack from the [releases](https://github.com/landaire/O7/releases) page and extract to your `res_mods\banks\mods` directory. At the time of writing that directory is `World of Warships\bin\3052606\res_mods\banks\mods\`. A more detailed installation guide can be found in the [INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) file.

## Development

A how-to guide for modifying the mod pack or creating your own can be found in the [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) document.

## Contact

If you are in the mod pack and would like your voice clip removed or have suggestions, feel free to reach out to me either through GitHub issues or via Discord (`landro#8016`).

## Known Issues

- Audio events for heavy damage taken are not played. I'm unsure if this is an issue with my testing or the game simply not triggering these events.
- When using the "Focus Fire" quick command `Dort_Destroyer` is played for all ships -- not just destroyers.
- `bfk_nom` plays most of the time when you land a torpedo on an enemy boat. If you land many torpedoes, the full voice clip plays for each torpedo. I'm not sure if this is a feature or a bug yet.

## Credits

Thanks to Pyrrhuloxia, Doyl3, tadpolefishtaco, and others in the O7 Discord for providing some of these audio clips.
